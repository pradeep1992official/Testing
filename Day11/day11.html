    <div id="fixed">
      The fixed position property in CSS is a positioning mechanism that allows
      an element to be positioned relative to the viewport, meaning it remains
      in a constant position even when the page is scrolled. This property is
      particularly useful for creating elements that should always be visible to
      the user, such as navigation bars or call-to-action buttons. When an
      element is assigned a fixed position, it is removed from the normal
      document flow, and its coordinates are defined using the top, right,
      bottom, and left properties, which specify its exact placement within the
      viewport. As a result, the element will not move with the rest of the
      content on the page, providing a consistent user experience regardless of
      scrolling behavior.
    </div>
    <p id="relative">
      The relative position property in CSS is a crucial aspect of web design
      that allows developers to adjust the placement of an element in relation
      to its normal position within the document flow. When an element is
      assigned a relative position, it can be moved from its original location
      without affecting the layout of surrounding elements. This property
      enables the use of offsets, such as top, right, bottom, and left, to
      fine-tune the element's placement, providing greater control over the
      visual arrangement of content on a webpage. By utilizing the relative
      position property, designers can create more dynamic and responsive
      layouts that enhance user experience and interaction.
    </p>
    <p id="sticky">
      The sticky position property in CSS is a unique positioning mechanism that
      allows an element to toggle between relative and fixed positioning
      depending on the user's scroll position. When an element is assigned a
      sticky position, it behaves like a relatively positioned element until it
      reaches a specified threshold defined by the top, right, bottom, or left
      properties. At that point, it becomes fixed in place, remaining visible on
      the screen as the user continues to scroll. This property is particularly
      useful for creating headers or navigation menus that remain accessible
      while the rest of the content scrolls, enhancing user experience by
      keeping important elements in view without obstructing the overall layout.

      <p id="absolute">
        Absolute positioning in CSS refers to a method of placing an element in
        a specific location within its containing element, allowing for precise
        control over its placement on the page. When an element is assigned an
        absolute position, it is removed from the normal document flow, meaning
        that it does not affect the positioning of other elements around it.
        Instead, the element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned
        ancestor, which is any ancestor element that has a position value other
        than static. If no such ancestor exists, the element will be positioned
        relative to the initial containing block, typically the viewport. This
        positioning technique is particularly useful for creating overlays,
        tooltips, or any design elements that require a specific layout
        independent of surrounding content.
