    <li><h2>Introduction to web Browser, Wars, DOM tree, CSSOM tree<br></h2>
        The Browser Wars were a period of intense competition between web browsers, primarily Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, in the 1990s. <br>
        Netscape initially dominated the market, but Microsoft's aggressive bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows led to a rapid shift in market share. <br>
        This competition spurred innovation in browser technology and ultimately shaped the modern internet landscape.<br>
    <li><h2>Browser internals - HTML parser <br></h2>

When a browser receives an HTML document, it goes through several steps to render the content on your screen. Here's a simplified overview of the process: <br>
<br>
<u>Loading:</u> The browser fetches the HTML content from the server or local storage.<br>
<br>
<u>Tokenization: </u>The HTML content is broken down into tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of meaningful data, such as tags ("div"), attributes (class="example"), and text nodes. <br>
<br>
<u>Lexical Analysis:</u> The tokens are analyzed to ensure they conform to the syntax rules of HTML. This step helps in identifying the structure and elements of the document. <br>
<br>
<u>Tree Construction:</u> <br>
&emsp;<u>DOM Tree:</u> The tokens are used to build the Document Object Model (DOM) tree. The DOM tree represents the structure of the HTML document as a tree of nodes, where each node corresponds to an element or piece of content in the HTML.<br>
&emsp;<u>CSSOM Tree:</u> If there are CSS styles, a CSS Object Model (CSSOM) tree is also constructed to represent the styles. <br>
<br>
<u>Rendering Tree:</u> The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to create the Render Tree. The Render Tree contains only the nodes required for rendering the page, excluding non-visual elements like "head" or elements with display: none. <br>
<br>
<u>Layout:</u> The browser calculates the position and size of each element in the Render Tree. This step is also known as "reflow."
<br><br>
<u>Painting:</u> Finally, the browser paints the pixels on the screen based on the calculated layout.

<h2>JavaScript V8 engine </h2>
The V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Google, is a high-performance open-source engine designed to execute JavaScript code efficiently. <br>Initially created for the Google Chrome web browser, V8 has become a key component in various applications and platforms, showcasing its versatility.
<br>
V8 employs a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation technique, translating JavaScript code into machine code right before execution.<br> This approach significantly boosts performance, allowing V8 to dynamically optimize code based on runtime characteristics. <br>The engine incorporates advanced features like inline caching, hidden classes, and adaptive optimizations, contributing to its ability to execute JavaScript rapidly.<br>

Memory management is handled by V8's garbage collector, responsible for reclaiming unused resources and ensuring efficient memory utilization.<br> Beyond Chrome, V8 has found widespread adoption, notably in the Node.js runtime environment, where its speed and adaptability have made it a preferred choice for server-side JavaScript applications.<br> Its continual evolution, marked by regular updates and enhancements, solidifies V8's position as a leading JavaScript engine, influencing the overall performance and responsiveness of JavaScript applications across diverse domains.

    <li><h2>Internals IP – MAC address – Ports & Evolution of HTTP</h2>
        An internal IP address, also known as a local IP address, is assigned by your local network router and is only visible to other devices within your local network <br>
        A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. <br>
        Port is a logical address of a 16-bit unsigned integer that is allotted to every application on the computer that uses the internet to send or receive data. <br><br>
